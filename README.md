A Deep Learning model that identifies handwritten digits written in different styles.

Aim: To build a deep learning model that can distinguish between handwritten digits numbered 0-9. The dataset used consists of 70,000 images, 60,000 in train data & 10,000 in test data by default.

Result: The model has shown a prediction accuracy of 98%.

Libraries used: Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy
