Aim: To build a supervised neural network that can distinguish between handwritten digits numbered 0-9. The model is trained on a dataset that consists of 70,000 images, 60,000 in train data & 10,000 in test data.

Result: The model has shown a prediction accuracy of ~98%.

Libraries used: Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Numpy
